        <p>The Lomo Saltado is a popular Peruvian Chinese-Peruvian fusion dish,characterized by pieces of beef (lomo) sauteed with onion,tomato and yellow chili, traditionally served with French fries and rice.</p>
        <h2>Indredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Pound of beef tenderloin, thinly sliced.</li>
            <li>2 Garlic cloves minced,Salt to taste,Pepper to  taste.</li>
            <li>1 Cup of regular long grain white rice, uncooked.</li>
            <li>2 Cups of frozen french fries.</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons of vegetable oil.</li>
            <li>1 Small red onion, thickly sliced.</li>
            <li>2 Roma tomatoes, thickly sliced.</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons of yellow chili paste.</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons of soy sauce.</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons red wine vinegar.</li>
            <li>1/3 Cup beef broth.</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup chopped cilantro.</li>            
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the meat: In a bowl, mix the strips of sirloin with the chopped garlic, salt, pepper, and cumin. Let it marinate for 10 to 15 minutes so the meat absorbs the flavors.</li>
            <li>Fry the potatoes: Prepare the fries. You can cut them into sticks and fry them until golden brown and crispy. Set them aside on a plate lined with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry the meat: Heat a wok or large skillet over very high heat with a little oil. When it's very hot, add the marinated meat in small batches so it doesn't steam. Sear the meat on all sides for 1-2 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sauté the vegetables: In the same wok with the meat juices, add a little more oil if necessary. Sauté the onion and yellow chili (if using) until the onion becomes translucent and the edges are golden, but still crispy.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato and sauce: Add the tomato and cook for 1-2 more minutes. Then, add the soy sauce, vinegar, and yellow chili paste. Cook until the sauce evaporates and caramelizes slightly.</li>
            <li>Combine all ingredients: Return the meat to the wok and mix everything quickly. At this point, you can add a splash of pisco to sauté if you like, although this is optional.</li>
            <li>Finish the dish: Add the chips and chopped cilantro. Mix one last time to combine the ingredients, making sure not to overcook them so they don't lose their texture.</li>
            <li>Serving: Serve the lomo saltado immediately, accompanied by cooked white rice. The dish should be piping hot to enjoy its freshness and juiciness.</li>
