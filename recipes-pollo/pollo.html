        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Pollo a la brasa is a specialty of Peruvian cuisine. It consists of a whole chicken, marinated in a mixture of herbs and spices, slowly cooked in a charcoal or wood-fired oven. The result is crispy, golden skin and incredibly juicy and tender meat with a distinctive smoky flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken: A whole chicken, which is marinated and cooked completely.</li>
            <li>Garlic: Several cloves of garlic, finely minced or crushed, to provide an intense and aromatic flavor.</li>
            <li>Soy sauce (sillao): Adds a salty and umami touch, and also helps with the coloring of the skin.</li>
            <li>Vinegar or lemon: Adds acidity and helps to tenderize the meat.</li>
            <li>Cumin: A fundamental spice that gives the marinade a warm and earthy flavor.</li>
            <li>Black pepper: Ground or whole, for a spicy and aromatic touch.</li>
            <li>Oregano: Preferably dried, for a classic herbaceous flavor.</li>
            <li>Paprika: Adds color and a slightly sweet or smoky flavor, depending on the type.</li>
            <li>Ají panca or ají amarillo: Peruvian chili pastes that add a unique flavor and a characteristic, subtle heat. It is a key ingredient for the traditional flavor.</li>
            <li>Vegetable or olive oil: Helps the spices adhere better to the chicken and contributes to crispy skin.</li>
            <li>Salt: Essential for seasoning and enhancing all the other flavors.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the marinade: Blend ají panca or ají amarillo paste, garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, cumin, oregano, pepper, paprika, and salt until smooth.</li>
            <li>Marinate the chicken: Coat the whole chicken with the blended mixture, making sure it's fully covered. Refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or ideally overnight, for the best flavor.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>3. Cook:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Oven method: Preheat the oven to a high temperature (around 450°F / 230°C). Roast for about 15 minutes, then reduce the heat to 325°F / 160°C and cook until the chicken is cooked through and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Grill method: Use medium-high indirect heat on the grill, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>   
            <li>Rest and serve: Let the chicken rest for 15 minutes before carving to keep it juicy. Serve with fries and salad.</li>        
        </ol>
