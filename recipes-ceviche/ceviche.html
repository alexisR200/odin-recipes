        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Pinch of pepper</li>
            <li>2 Pounds of fish of your choice</li>
            <li>1 Onion cut into julienne strips</li>
            <li>Â¼ Cup chopped cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1 Chopped yellow pepper</li>
            <li>1 Chopped limo chili (for decoration)</li>
            <li>12 Lemons</li>
            <li>1 Pinch of salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 Cup of fish broth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>To accompany:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Boiled tender corn</li>
            <li>1 Boiled sweet potato</li>
            <li>1 Bunch of lettuce leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Prepare the tiger's milk:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>In the blender, place the juice of 1-2 lemons, some fish cubes, a piece of onion, a piece of limo chili, a few cilantro stalks and, optionally, the garlic.</li>
            <li>Blend for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Strain the mixture and reserve the "tiger's milk" in the refrigerator.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>2. Marinate the fish:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the cut fish in a glass or stainless steel bowl.</li>
            <li>Season the fish with salt to taste and add the chopped limo chili. Stir gently.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>3. Integrate the flavors:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the remaining lemon juice and reserved "tiger's milk" over the fish.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped cilantro and mix with a spoon. The marinating time is very short in authentic Peruvian ceviche, so the fish doesn't overcook and retains its freshness.</li>
            <li>Adjust the salt if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>4. Add the onion:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the julienned red onion, previously washed.</li>
            <li>Mix one last time gently.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>5. Serve:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Serve the ceviche immediately in deep bowls to keep the juices cool.</li>
            <li>Accompany each dish with sweet potato and corn.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the popcorn on top or serve it on the side for a crunchy touch.</li>
            <li>The remaining liquid in the dish, the "tiger's milk," is also a fundamental part of the experience.</li>
        </ol>
